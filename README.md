# Malaria-cell-classification-using-CNN


The exam focused on developing a deep neural network using PyTorch for training to distinguish 
all types of malaria cells. The network primarily focused on the multi-label classification of seven 
different types of cell categories [’difficult’, ’gametocyte’, ’leukocyte’, ’red blood cell’, ’ring’, 
’schizont’, ’trophozoite’]. The metrics: Accuracy and HLM were used to measure the performance 
of the models.
During the seven-day challenge, the best model developed had a sum score (accuracy and hlm) of 
0.4495.
